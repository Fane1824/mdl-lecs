# Introduction

This is a repository storing the lectures slides for "Machine, Data, and Learning" for the Spring 2025 semester. 

# Notes

## Lecture 1

- A little bit blurry

## Lecture 3

- Start of 3 lecture is partly omitted because it contained some duplicate slides from the end of lecture 2
- An exercise from this lecture consisting of 2 slides (one describing the problem and the other describing the solution) is missing. If anyone has pictures of this exercise, please forward it to me.
