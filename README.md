# Notes

## Lecture 1 

- A little bit blurry

## Lecture 3

- The start of 3 lecture is partly omitted because it contained some duplicate slides from the end of lecture 2
- An exercise from this lecture consisting of 2 slides (one describing the problem and the other describing the solution) is missing. If anyone has pictures of this exercise, please forward it to me.
